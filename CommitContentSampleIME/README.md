Android CommitContentSampleIME Sample
===================================

This sample demonstrates how to write an keyboard which sends rich content (such as images) to text
fields using the Commit Content API.

Introduction
------------

Users often want to communicate with emojis, stickers, and other kinds of rich content. In previous
versions of Android, soft keyboards (input method editors or IMEs) could send only unicode emoji to
apps. For rich content (such as images), apps had to either build app-specific APIs that couldn't
be used in other apps or use workarounds like sending images through the Easy Share Action or the
clipboard.

Now in Android 7.1 (API 25), the Android SDK includes the [Commit Content API][1], which provides a
universal way for IMEs to send images and other rich content directly to a text editor in an app.
The API is also available in the v13 Support Library (ver. 25.0), supporting devices as early as
Android 3.2 (API 13).

With this API, you can build messaging apps that accept rich content from any keyboard, as well as
keyboards that can send rich content to any app.

**Note:** This sample does not have a default Activity. After installing it, you will need to enable
this app as a keyboard by navigating to *Settings > Languages & Input > Virtual Keyboard > Manage
Keyboards*. This keyboard can then be accessed by pressing the virtual keyboard icon in the
lower-right hand corner of the display while in a text field.

Without default Activity Android Studio doesn't let you 'run' the application. Generating an apk
file should work fine. Alternatively see [#18](https://github.com/android/input-samples/issues/18).
